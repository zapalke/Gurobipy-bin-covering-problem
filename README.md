# bin-covering-problem
BCP done in Gurobi solver.
This is a modified version of BCP.
It is set to maximie value of items that we throw insted of maximising bin coverage.
All in all it's more like a Backpack Problem for multiple backpacks but to make it an actual BCP you just need to change objective to maximise summarised size.
